This project aims to simplify the picture of proteomic studies without losing fine details. These studies are defined in the medical literature by data from myriad quantitative techniques that are difficult to distil holistically. The original thrust was determining which exact proteomic gene products were confined within plasma membranes.  According to the work of Singer and Nicolson from Science 175; 720-731; 1972, these proteins could be thought of as being constrained in space along folded sheets confined to two dimensional diffusion only, as opposed to having complete freedom to diffuse in three dimensions.  This idea was coined the Fluid Mosaic Model (FMM) of the Structure of Cell Membranes.  The raw proteomic data chosen for this study was obtained from the UniProt Knowledgebase provided publicly at http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb. As this work evolved, a four compartment model proposed by Satoh et al from Multiple Sclerosis; 15: 531-541; doi:10.1177/1352458508101943; 2009 was used.  This four compartment model was 1) nuclear, 2) cytosolic, 3) membrane, and 4) extracellular proteins.
